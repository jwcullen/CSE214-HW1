In this assignment, you will implement a database for baseball card collectors to keep track of their collections. A baseball card has a player name, team, position, card manufacturer, set, year, image size, price, statistics, and many other pieces of information. In this assignment, we will only store data about some of these. The database will hold at most 100 cards, a number which should be declared as a final variable.
